# Sanity assessment — fixture

A record of how well this repo might read to someone who has not read it.

Each entry in the files below is one **reading**: an agent was shown a
function's name, signature, neighboring function names and comments, but never
its body. It was asked what it expected to find. Then it was given the file
and asked to explain the difference.

**These files are meant to be read.**

You do not need the Sanity CLI or GUI to get the information out of them: open
one and read it like notes from a code review.

| area | read | of | unpredicted | stale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [root](readings/root.md) | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| **total** | **2** | **2** | **0** | **0** |

## Seeing it as a map

Sanity draws this repo as a sunburst with every file and function represented,
colored by predictability, legibility, doc coverage, churn, and nine other
dimensions. Open the app to visualize these readings.

```
brew install --cask monsterdept/tap/sanity
```

Or download it for macOS, Linux or Windows from <https://sanity.monster>.

## Updating this assessment

Readings go stale. Each one records a hash of the code and the comments it was
made against, so when either moves out from under a reading, Sanity marks it
STALE and offers it for re-reading before anything else.

Coding agents do the reading, and Sanity runs them. From this repo:

```
sanity init
sanity check
```

Or add the repo in the app and press Read.

Each reader is a separate process started outside this directory with no
access to the repo. It sees only what Sanity hands it. The window does not
have to be open while it works.

## Commit this directory

A reading is minutes of careful work and tokens spent. Commit it so others can
benefit from it.

Everything here is yours, and Sanity claims no rights in it. The text Sanity
writes here, including this file and the rule descriptions under `rules/`, is
dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0, so committing this directory
adds no license terms to this repo.
